# Cider Fire - Sexy Fiery Particles in SDDM 👹👯‍👀

Cider fire is a particle based fire simulation based on **SDL**. I am making this program as a part of my semester final software project.
Eventually I want to hook the entire application through SDDM so that I can see pretty fire before logging into X (or wayland)! 

## Requirements

- SDL
- CMake
- Clang
- Linux or Mac (Windows might or might not work, I couldn't get it working)

## Build Instruction

Clone this project and cd into the directory. Then issue this command:

``clang++ main.cpp sdl-config --libs --cflag``

## Todo

- [x] Make the program GCC compatible (Remove clang optimization flag)!
- [ ] Add instruction to hookup through SDDM. 
- [ ] Optimize performance.
- [x] Amaze my girlfriend! 😍 😘 

## Dedication

As with everything I append with cider, this is a project dedicated to my gf, whom I call "Half a pint cider"!
