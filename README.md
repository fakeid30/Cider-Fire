### Cider Fire

Cider fire is a particle based fire simulation based on **SDL**. I am making this program as a part of my semester final software project.

## Requirements

- SDL
- CMake
- Clang
- Linux or Mac (Windows might or might not work, I couldn't get it working)

## Build Instruction

Clone this project and cd into the directory. Then issue this command:

``clang++ main.cpp sdl-config --libs --cflag``
