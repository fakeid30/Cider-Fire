# Cider Fire - Sexy fire particle in SDDM 👹👯‍👀

Cider fire is a particle based fire simulation based on **SDL**. I am making this program as a part of my semester final software project.
Eventually I want to hook the entire application through SDDM so that I can see pretty fire before logging into X (or wayland)! 

## Requirements

- SDL
- CMake
- Clang
- Linux or Mac (Windows might or might not work, I couldn't get it working)

## Build Instruction

Clone this project and cd into the directory. Then issue this command:

``clang++ main.cpp sdl-config --libs --cflag``

## Dedication

As with everything I append with cider, this is a project dedicated to my gf, whom I call "Half a pint cider"!
